    "As of a late 2023 report, the bank operates with 1.066 branches domestically, giving it one of the largest branch networks in Turkey. İşbank also has 22 branches across 11 different countries. The bank provides services to 24.3 million customers as of 2023.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "History\n",
    "Following the culmination of World War I in 1918 and the subsequent dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, Turkey was declared a republic with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as the president. Atatürk acknowledged the government’s need for a national financial institution to rebuild Turkey's economy following the debacle of the war. İşbank was founded on 26 August 1924 at the First Economy Congress in İzmir.[7]\n",
    "Atatürk appointed Celâl Bayar, his close aide and then the Minister of Exchange Construction and Settlement, as the president of the newly formed bank. İşbank began operations with two branches and 37 staff under the leadership of Celâl Bayar, its first general manager. The bank was established with a capital of 1,000,000 TL of which 250,000 TL was covered by Atatürk himself, and the rest by private investors.[8] In 1927, the capital was raised by 2 Million TL so it could be merged with the National Credit Bank as equal partners.[9]\n",
    "Established to utilize the smallest savings and transfer them to development, İşbank played a major role in the establishment and development of savings awareness in Turkish society, bringing the first piggy banks to Turkey in 1928.[10] In the following years, İşbank began to expand by opening branches across the country. In 1932, İşbank opened branches in Hamburg, Germany and Alexandria, Egypt, becoming the first Turkish bank to open branches abroad. In the 1950s,[11] İşbank expanded its portfolio of subsidiaries. The bank's subsidiaries became the driving force of Turkish industry, investing in and financing a wide range of businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Having accelerated branch expansion in the 1960s and 1970s, İşbank paid special attention to the development of its overseas branch network in the 1980s. In the 1980s, İşbank began to offer a wide range of services to its customers in line with its multichannel banking vision. In 1982, İşbank introduced the first Automated Teller Machines (ATM) to Turkey, and at the same time, the bank named its ATMs as \"Bankamatik\" and registered this name as a trademark. With the launch of the \"Blue Line\" in 1991[12] and the first internet branch in 1997, İşbank assumed a pioneering role in this field. Since those years, İşbank has been carrying out R&D activities and studies on the use of new technologies to increase the quality and diversity of its services in line with the wishes and expectations of its customers.\n",

    "The Chronomancer’s Emissary\n",
    "Prologue\n",
    "\n",
    "In the year 2589, humanity had not only conquered the stars but had fractured the very fabric of time itself. Known as the “Chronomancers,” a select group of scientists had harnessed temporal energy, allowing humanity to traverse time and alter its course. However, meddling with time had unforeseen consequences. The universe was fracturing, time was leaking, and events from other periods bled unpredictably into the present. To counteract the chaos, the Chronomancers established the Temporal Enforcement Agency, or TEA, which sent specialized agents known as Emissaries to repair the timelines and prevent collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such Emissary was Kaden Sato. Strong-willed and fiercely intelligent, Kaden had been chosen for his unparalleled understanding of quantum mechanics and his bravery in the face of uncharted danger. Little did he know that he would soon embark on a mission unlike any before, one that would change the fate of time itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 1: The Ripple\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaden sat in the briefing room of the TEA headquarters, his face illuminated by the cold blue light of the holographic interface in front of him. The Chronomancer Council, an assembly of the most brilliant minds in temporal science, looked down upon him through the hologram, their faces obscured by shadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Kaden,” began Dr. Myra Elara, a stoic yet compassionate woman who had been Kaden’s mentor for years. “We’ve detected an anomaly in the year 2024. It’s… different from previous incidents. It’s not just an object or a person out of place. It’s an entire event.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“An event?” Kaden raised an eyebrow, intrigued.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Precisely,” she replied. “It’s something we call a Ripple Event. Somehow, a monumental event from 2145 has slipped back in time and is altering the entire flow of history in 2024.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s the event?” Kaden asked, leaning forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s the Fusion Accord – the day humanity achieved unlimited energy. If this event occurs prematurely, the energy infrastructure of 2024 won’t handle it, potentially leading to a cataclysmic overload and collapse of global civilization.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaden’s heart pounded. He’d been trained for irregularities, but an entire event displacement was unprecedented.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You’ll be sent back to 2024 to correct this,” Myra continued, “and you’ll be given access to advanced temporal suppression equipment. Your mission is to locate the epicenter of the Ripple, determine the cause, and neutralize it. Time is already destabilizing; the longer we wait, the greater the damage.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaden nodded, feeling the weight of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2: Arrival in 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal displacement was jarring, as it always was. Kaden found himself standing in a busy street in New York City, his body adjusting to the unfamiliar sounds, smells, and sights of an era that felt almost quaint to him. People brushed past him, unaware of the massive temporal energy fluctuation he had just unleashed upon arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "He took a deep breath, activating his Temporal Inhibitor, a device strapped to his wrist that helped conceal his presence from anyone actively looking for disruptions in the timeline. The Inhibitor also fed him real-time data about the surrounding area. Glancing down, he saw an alert flashing: Anomaly detected. Epicenter identified - East Village Laboratory, January 12, 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making his way to the lab, Kaden felt an unshakable sense of urgency. As he approached, he noticed a heavy military presence, far too significant for a standard laboratory. Were they aware of the anomaly?\n",
    "\n",
    "He quickly activated his Temporal Cloak, allowing him to move unseen, and slipped into the facility. He found the lab filled with computers, scientists, and a device he instantly recognized – a rudimentary fusion reactor, decades ahead of its time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Impossible…” he whispered, approaching the reactor. His Inhibitor pinged with information: Temporal Signature: Year 2145.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone had brought the technology from the future. But who?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3: The Conspiracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaden’s investigation led him to a series of encrypted files on one of the lab computers. Decoding them, he discovered the existence of a clandestine organization known as “The Continuum,” a rogue faction of scientists and engineers who believed the TEA was restricting humanity’s potential by controlling the timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Continuum’s manifesto declared that “Time belongs to all of humanity, not just the chosen few,” and they had been manipulating events throughout history to accelerate technological advancement. It was their belief that humanity was ready for fusion power, regardless of the instability it would cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaden realized the stakes were higher than he had initially thought. This wasn’t just a single incident; it was part of a larger plan to rewrite human history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4: The Shadowed Ally\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaden soon discovered that he was not the only Emissary in 2024. Rumors whispered of another agent who had gone rogue, possibly working with the Continuum. Her name was Elise Tanaka, and she was once the finest operative TEA had ever trained. She had disappeared years ago, presumed dead in an accident involving temporal energy overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking her movements across 2024, Kaden found her in an abandoned building in Brooklyn. She looked at him with a wry smile, her face illuminated by the soft glow of a fusion core.\n",
    "\n",
    "“So they finally sent you,” she said, her voice a strange mixture of bitterness and relief.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Elise,” he whispered, “why did you join them?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“They’re not wrong, Kaden,” she replied, her eyes flashing with conviction. “Time shouldn’t be controlled. It should be free, accessible to everyone. The TEA isn’t protecting history; they’re holding humanity back.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“By destabilizing entire centuries? You’re playing with forces you barely understand.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Maybe,” she admitted. “But we’ve grown too cautious, too afraid of change.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He realized she was not the villain he had imagined. She truly believed that by unleashing technological advances, she was giving humanity a chance to evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "But he couldn’t let her continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 5: The Showdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The climax of their struggle took place in the heart of the Continuum’s secret headquarters – a hidden facility beneath the streets of Manhattan, where the stolen fusion reactor was kept. As Kaden fought his way through Elise’s allies, he saw visions of the future flickering around him – alternate timelines where humanity had risen to great heights and others where it had been reduced to ashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the facility, Kaden and Elise stood face to face, each determined to fight for their beliefs.\n",

    "“No,” he replied. “I’m afraid of chaos.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, Kaden managed to disable Elise’s Temporal Inhibitor, leaving her vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It doesn’t have to end like this,” he pleaded. “Come back with me. We can find a way to use this technology responsibly.”\n",
    "\n",
